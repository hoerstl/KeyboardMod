Lived off a version of loaded mashed potatoes for a few days it was delicious. Pureed some roasted squash and turnip mixed with well steamed broccoli and mashed potatoes. If you go heavy on the cream cheese, salt/pepper, butter and milk/cream it goes down easy.

Greek yogurt w/ honey, or different flavored yougurts

Avocado??

Mashed Beans
