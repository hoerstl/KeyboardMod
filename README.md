# KeyboardMod
The mission of this project is to allow the user to create their own keyboard shortcuts that
can have python-integrated functionality such as running other sub-modules with the press of a
button or rebinding keys to complete complex tasks using other python modules.

Motivation: I, Lawrence, wanted to increase my productivity with a keyboard and reduce the time 
my hands spend moving away from the home row on my keyboard.

Functionalities:
- Pressing and holding the caps-lock key rebinds every key on the keyboard, entering 'CapMode'
- Releasing both Lshift and Rshift at the same time rebinds every key on the keyboard separately in 'ShiftLock'
- ShiftLock can be toggled via the same shortcut or by entering and leaving 'CapMode'
- Provides a library of common-use functions for keyboard customization
