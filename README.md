# KeyboardMod

## Mission
Our goal is to allow users to create their own keyboard shortcuts that
have python-integrated functionality such as running other sub-modules with the press of a 
button or rebinding keys to complete complex tasks using other python modules.

Motivation: I, Lawrence, wanted to increase my productivity with a keyboard and reduce the time 
my hands spend moving away from the home row on my keyboard. I also thought it would be excellent
to bind the scripts I write to make me more powerful on my machines.

## Functionalities:
- Pressing and holding the caps-lock key rebinds every key on the keyboard, entering 'CapMode'
- Releasing both Lshift and Rshift at the same time rebinds every key on the keyboard separately in 'ShiftLock'
- ShiftLock can be toggled via the same shortcut or by entering and leaving 'CapMode'
- Provides a library of common-use functions for keyboard customization 


## Built in Functionality:

### CapMode 
By pressing and holding the caps lock key, CapMode is enabled and rebinds keys. Here are some
of the bindings implemented by default:

| Key | Action                                                                         |

|  f  | right one word                                                                 |

| space | press and hold to act as shift <br> while in CapMode                           |




## Known issues

- The crtl mode cannot handle the typing of some characters. typeCharacter() needs some work. Currently values are hardcoded and that's limited.
can't type '_'
- When opening a notepad, the window sometimes does not take focus over other windows. We need a try/catch with a for loop.
